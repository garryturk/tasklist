Easiest way to run is  via  docker, dockerfile and compose files are provided. These use localstack for a local 
AWS implementation.

To build the docker image:
docker build -t listapi .

Then:
docker-compose up

The service runs on port 3000 with a root path of /tasks. See the EXAMPLES file for curl examples
